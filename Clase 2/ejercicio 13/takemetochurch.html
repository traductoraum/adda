    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <div id="letra" style="width: 600px; height: 800px;">
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        My lover's got humor
        She's the giggle at a funeral
        Knows everybody's disapproval
        I should've worshiped her sooner
        If the Heavens ever did speak
        She's the last true mouthpiece
        Every Sunday's getting more bleak
        A fresh poison each week
        "We were born sick", you heard them say it
        My church offers no absolutes
        She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
        The only Heaven I'll be sent to
        Is when I'm alone with you
        I was born sick, but I love it
        Command me to be well
        A-, Amen, Amen, Amen
        Take me to church
        I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
        I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
        Offer me that deathless death
        Good God, let me give you my life
        Take me to church
        I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
        I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
        Offer me that deathless death
        Good God, let me give you my life
        If I'm a pagan of the good times
        My lover's the sunlight
        To keep the Goddess on my side
        She demands a sacrifice
        Drain the whole sea
        Get something shiny
        Something meaty for the main course
        That's a fine looking high horse
        What you got in the stable?
        We've a lot of starving faithful
        That looks tasty
        That looks plenty
        This is hungry work
        Take me to church
        I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
        I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
        Offer me my deathless death
        Good God, let me give you my life
        Take me to church
        I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
        I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
        Offer me my deathless death
        Good God, let me give you my life
        No masters or kings when the ritual begins
        There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
        In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
        Only then I am human
        Only then I am clean
        Oh, oh, Amen, Amen, Amen
        Take me to church
        I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
        I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
        Offer me that deathless death
        Good God, let me give you my life
        Take me to church
        I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
        I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
        Offer me that deathless death
        Good God, let me give you my life</p>
